                                                  Outlier Detection using Z-Score

This project demonstrates how to detect outliers in a dataset using the Z-score method. Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the other observations in the dataset. Identifying and managing outliers is crucial as they can significantly affect the performance of machine learning models and statistical analysis.


                                                         Introduction

Outlier detection is an essential step in data preprocessing, especially for datasets used in statistical analysis and machine learning. This project focuses on using Z-scores to detect outliers. A Z-score measures how far a data point is from the mean, in terms of standard deviations.


                                                      What is Z-Score?

The Z-score is a standardized way of measuring the deviation of a data point from the dataset's mean. It is calculated as:

                                                         𝑍=𝑋−𝜇/𝜎

​Where:

X is the data point

𝜇 is the mean of the dataset

𝜎 is the standard deviation of the dataset


                                                 A data point with a Z-score:
*Close to 0 indicates that it is near the mean.

*Greater than a threshold (commonly 3 or -3) is considered an outlier.



                                                  Steps to Detect Outliers
~ Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation:     Compute the mean (μ) and standard deviation (𝜎) of the dataset.

~ Compute Z-Score for Each Data Point :     For each data point, calculate the Z-score using the formula above.


~ Set a Threshold :                         Typically, data points with a Z-score greater than 3 or less than -3 are considered outliers.

~ Flag Outliers :                           Identify the data points that fall outside the Z-score threshold.



                                                      Conclusion

In this project, we explored how to detect outliers in data using the Z-score method. The Z-score is a simple and effective way to identify data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset, allowing you to handle anomalies in your data preprocessing phase.
